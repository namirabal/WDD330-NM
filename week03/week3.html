        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Callback functions, what is the main purpose, and how it works? <br>
            Because at the beginning it used in the codes the word "callback" <br>
            but after I could not identify when it is used callback functions <br>
            because the use of the word "callback" doesn't appear. <br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Event Listeners: What is the functionallity of this events? We must write <br>
            in every code for example, the coordinated events, with sceenX and screenY, <br>
            or we must to guess if the user will click or touch on the screen or if he <br>
            will press a button on the keyboard? I don't understand the specific function <br>
            or a clear example of this.
