        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1- Callback functions, what is the main purpose, and how it works?
            Because at the beginning it used in the codes the word "callback" 
            but after I could not identify when it is used callback functions 
            because the use of the word "callback" doesn't appear. (\n)

            2- Event Listeners: What is the functionallity of this events? We must write
            in every code for example, the coordinated events, with sceenX and screenY, 
            or we must to guess if the user will click or touch on the screen or if he 
            will press a button on the keyboard? I don't understand the specific function 
            or a clear example of this.
