            Testing and Debugging: It is understandable that a code must be well developed in order<br>
            to have a better flow of the program, but my question is if there is an easier way <br>
            to debug without all those options like 'use strict'; or const error = new Error ();<br>
            Is there not an extension that helps the program to recognize errors automatically?
          </li>

            Modular JS I understand that is similar to OOP, what are the main differences <br>
