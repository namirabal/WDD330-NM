        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I'm trying to understand better functions and the difference between variables, <br>
            because I read a const as a variable and also a var as a variable, so how variable<br>
            are. Also this week I could learn that some of the functionalities for example buttons, <br>
            are possible to apply only in JS, in fact, if I not misunderstood, the button function <br>
            is one action from JS and not from HTML.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
