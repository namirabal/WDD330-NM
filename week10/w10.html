            Validating forms: <br />
            Form validation can be observed when a user enters data on a web
            page, or form. <br />
            When entering any incorrect data, the web throws an alert message,
            indicating messages<br />
            such as the following:<br />
            "This field is required"<br />
            "Please enter a valid email"<br />
            "the data entered must be only numbers", etc.<br />
            Data validation, both on the client and server-side, helps security
            on websites. When the user<br />
            enters the information correctly, the application allows the data to
            be sent to the server<br />
            by storing it, usually in a database. Otherwise, if the information
            entered is incorrect,<br />
            the application will not allow the data to be sent to the server.<br />
            Form validation mainly serves three things:<br />
            1-Obtain the correct data in the correct way, so that in this way it
            is stored in the correct format.<br />
            2- Protect user data, to protect your information.<br />
            3- Protect ourselves. <br />
            Form validation can be done in HTML, in a default way, or Java
            Script, in a more personalized way.<br />
            The data can have a pseudo-class of: valid or: invalid

            Using Fetch: Basically, it is an interface for the use of Ajax<br />
            (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) with Javascript. An API is used to
            access<br />
            server resources asynchronously, using on 'promises'. The promise
            object,<br />
            returned from fetch () does not it will be rejected with an error
            status<br />
            even if it is an HTTP 404 or 500 error. Instead, it will be resolved
            with<br />
            an 'ok' status set to 'false'.<br />
            How to perform a fetch () request:<br />
            fetch ('http://example.com/movies.json')<br />
            .then (response => response.json ())<br />
            .then (data => console.log (data));<br />
            A fetch () request will be rejected with 'TypeError' when a network
            error is encountered.<br />
